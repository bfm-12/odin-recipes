This is a basic exercise in HTML to illustrate making a very bare-bones website.
This website only uses HTML; no CSS has been applied, so excuse the ugly.
The lesson aims to teach building an entire website, using Git for version control, and how to push the entire website to a GitHub repo from the command line.
(For reference, I am using a Bash script in a Linux Xubuntu terminal.)
