        <h1>Odin Recipes: Recipes from an Amateur</h1>
        <h4>The premiere website for recipes that sure are a thing!</h4>
        <p>Welcome to my amateur recipe blog! This site contains a few of my favorite recipes that I have both made and experienced, whether they were good or not. All recipes feature ingredient lists, instructions, rankings, and rankings with rice (very important). Now, <strong>let's get cooking</strong>!</p>

        Recipes for when you need actual nutrition or whatever--boring, but delicious.
