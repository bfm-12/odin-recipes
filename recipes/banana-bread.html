        <p>Banana bread is a staple for people who love to buy bananas and forget to eat them before they're too ripe--which is everyone, I think. Listen, we have enough to keep track of every day without micromanaging ripening fruit, so let's make this easy recipe and stop arguing about who spends too much of the budget on produce Now, <strong>let's get cooking</strong>!</p>

        <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
        If you have too many ripe bananas on hand, everything else on this list should be a pantry staple. Yay, convenience!
        <ul>
            <li>3 overripe bananas, mashed</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter, melted and cooled</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1-ish teaspoon vanilla extract (measure with your heart)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        Banana bread is stupid easy to make, and even easier when you don't have to cream the sugar into the butter. This recipe avoids that, so you can basically make it while you're asleep and not mess it up.
        <ol>
            <li>If you didn't mash your bananas already, mash them now until they're smooth. Leave no chunky bits behind.</li>
            <li>Add in melted butter and mix until combined.</li>
            <li>Add in egg, beating slightly before you combine with the banana-butter mixture, and then fully incorporate into mix.</li>
            <li>Add vanilla, baking soda, and salt and stir until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add in sugar and stir until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Fold in flour until just combined. Do not over-mix.</li>
            <li><strong>Bonus step:</strong> If you want to add a mix-in like chocolate chips or walnuts, do that now. Fold in gently.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into greased 9-by-5 loaf pan.</li>
            <li>Bake loaf for 45 to 55 minutes or until it smells done (you'll know).</li>
            <li>Allow loaf to cool in pan for approximately ten minutes, then turn out of pan to cool completely on rack.</li>
            <li>Slice and serve. Enjoy warm or at room temperature.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Ratings</h2>
        We made it, we ate it, and now we rank it.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Rating: 8/10</strong>: Soft, sweet, and bursting with banana flavor. It's an excellent base for adding chocolate chips, walnuts, or cinnamon to take this loaf to the next level.</li>
            <li><strong>Rating with Rice: 4/10</strong>: No. Why would you do that? Use one of the additions above insted. Still, not the worst thing I've eaten, so we'll give it a 4.</li>
        </ul>
