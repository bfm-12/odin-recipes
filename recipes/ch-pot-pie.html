        <h2>Chicken Pot Pie the Lazy Way</h2>

        <br><em>(Image from Pillsbury, just like this recipe)</em>
        <p>Who doesn't love a chicken pot pie? Tyrants, probably, but we can't say for sure. Who loves being lazy? Basically everyone. We could get lazier and just pop a frozen pot pie in the oven, but apparently that's "not real cooking" and "doesn't take the weight of domestic labor off my shoulders." Oh, well--this is an adequate substitute, I guess. Now, <strong>let's get cooking</strong>!</p>

        <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
        I hate to break it to you, but you're going to have to go to the grocery store, probably.
        <ul>
            <li>1 box Pillsbury premade pie crusts</li>
            <li>1/3 cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>1/2 onion, diced</li>
            <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 3/4 cups chicken stock</li>
            <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
            <li>2 cups frozen vegetables</li>
            <li>2 1/2 cups shredded chicken, cooked</li>
            <li>Salt, black pepper, and (optional) dry poultry spice mix, to taste</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        The process sounds more involved than it is; be not afraid.
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425 degrees fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>Unroll one premade pie crust and place in glass or ceramic pie plate. Reserve second crust for later.</li>
            <li>On the stove over medium heat, melt butter and add onion, cooking until softened.</li>
            <li>Add flour and whisk until incorporated.</li>
            <li>Add in chicken stock and milk, then stir mixture until it thickens to a gravy consistency.</li>
            <li>Add in salt and pepper to taste. If desired, add optional dry poultry spice mix.</li>
            <li>Stir in frozen vegetables and precooked chicken.</li>
            <li>Spoon filling into pie crust from step 2, then unroll reserved pie crust, top, and seal edges. Remember to slit the top crust in several places to allow to steam to vent.</li>
            <li>Bake for 30 to 40 minutes or until pie smells done (you'll know). Allow to stand for five minutes until serving.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Ratings</h2>
        We made it, we ate it, and now we rank it.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Rating: 7/10</strong>: It's delicious, it's easy, and it's filling. A solid meal.</li>
            <li><strong>Rating with Rice: 7/10</strong>: The rice doesn't add, but it doesn't detract either. The score remains the same.</li>
        </ul>
