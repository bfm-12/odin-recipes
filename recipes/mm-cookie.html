        <p>Do you love chocolate chip cookies, but hate too much melty chocolate at once? No? Why does everyone say that's just me? I swear, it's not that weird. Anyway, this recipe solves that problem and is better anyway. Now, <strong>let's get cooking</strong>!</p>

        <h2>The Ingredients</h2>
        If you can keep M&M's in the house long enough to bake these before everyone else eats them, everything else on this list should be a pantry staple. Yay, convenience!
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 cup light brown sugar, packed</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
            <li>1-ish tablespoon vanilla extract (measure with your heart)</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups M&M candies</li>
            <li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Process</h2>
        Listen to me: do not attempt to cream the butter and sugar together by hand like I did. Yes, you can do it. Yes, it's a decent arm workout (but only on one side). Just use the hand mixer and save yourself the lopsided biceps, okay?
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees Fahrenheit.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, use hand mixer to beat together butter, brown sugar and granulated sugar until light and fluffy.</li>
            <li>Add eggs and vanilla and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Add in flour, baking soda, and salt and mix until just combined.</li>
            <li>Fold in M&M's and chocolate chips. It will look like too much chocolate; it is not and this is normal. </li>
            <li>Chill dough for approximately 30 minutes. This is important to keep dough from overspreading.</li>
            <li>Scoop cookie dough using a standard cookie scoop onto baking sheet lined with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Bake cookies for about 9 minutes and remove from oven, then allow cookies to stand 5 minutes on baking sheet to finish baking on carryover.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes on baking sheet, transfer cookies to wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            <li>Enjoy warm (if you like melty chocolate, which is weird, but fine, I guess) or at room temperature. Cookies will keep an an airtight container for about a week (if they last that long).</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>The Ratings</h2>
        We made it, we ate it, and now we rank it.
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Base Rating: 9/10</strong>: Amazing. The vanilla really elevates these cookies and makes them one of a kind. <strog>Pro tip:</strog> Try not to eat four at once. It's easy, but the ensuing tummy ache isn't.</li>
            <li><strong>Rating with Rice: 5/10</strong>: Again, that's a weird thing to eat with cookies, but I'm not judging. The goodness of the cookie holds the ranking aloft despite the rice.</li>
        </ul>
